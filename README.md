# 📦 Blinkit Store Launch Staffing Guestimate

## Project Overview

This project estimates the staffing requirements for Blinkit’s upcoming store in Pune, focusing on two main areas:
- 🚚 **Delivery Partners**: Estimated the number of delivery drivers needed to handle 2000 daily orders while meeting Blinkit's fast delivery targets.
- 🏬 **Store Workers**: Evaluated the number of workers required to efficiently pick and pack orders within the store.

## Key Insights

- **Delivery Partners Required**: ~176 drivers to ensure smooth operations, including a 20% buffer for absences and peak demand.
- **Store Workers Required**: ~29 workers to manage picking and packing tasks with optimal efficiency.

## Recommendations

The calculations provide estimates to ensure operational readiness, accounting for a 6-day workweek and 7-day operations.
